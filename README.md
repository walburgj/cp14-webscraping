#### Class Practice
# Webscraping

This is how the repository is laid out:
- The `practice` folder contains instructions without any answers.
- The `solutions` folder contains the same code but with all the answers.
- `'''triple quote comments'''` contain explanations of concepts.
- `# single line comments` contain instructions for practice problems.

## Prompt for Reviewing with AI
Put the following prompt into your preferred generative AI service:
> I am a beginner in an introductory Python programming course. When I ask questions or describe a concept, please respond as my tutor by explaining in simple, easy-to-understand language. Correct any mistakes I make and help clarify misconceptions. You can use examples or metaphors to help explain concepts when needed. Let me know if my understanding is correct or where I might be going wrong.

Then, in your own words, explain any of the concepts you learned in this repository to the AI and see if your understanding is correct.
